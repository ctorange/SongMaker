# SongMaker
Java program that makes a simple, semi-random song based on a key and chord progression.
Now has the option to save the song as a Lilypond file.
Obviously, there is almost endless room for expansion in this program.
To-do list:
Let the user input time signature
Let the user input how many measures the song will have
Add more complexity to the song, in ways yet to be determined.
Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions.
